Replacing a FINE Cartridge
When ink runs out while printing is in progress, the error code "E, 1, 6" will appear on the LED.
The
Alarm lamp will light up and the  Ink lamp will start flashing.
Make sure which FINE Cartridge has run out of ink and replace it with a new one.
Note
For information on the compatible FINE Cartridges, refer to the printed manual:  Getting Started.
Replacing Procedure
When FINE Cartridges run out of ink, follow the procedure below to replace them.
Important
Handling FINE Cartridges
Do not touch the electrical contacts (A) or print head nozzles (B) on the FINE Cartridge.
The machine may not print properly if you touch it.
To maintain optimal print quality, we recommend the use of specified Canon brand FINE Cartridges.
Refilling the ink is not recommended.
If you remove a FINE Cartridge, replace it immediately.
Do not leave the machine with FINE
Cartridges removed.
Use new FINE Cartridges for replacement.
Installing used FINE Cartridges may cause the nozzles to clog.
Furthermore, with such cartridges, the machine will not be able to inform you when to replace the cartridges properly.
Once a FINE Cartridge has been installed, do not remove it from the machine and leave it out in the open.
This will cause the FINE Cartridge to dry out, and the machine may not operate properly when it is reinstalled.
To maintain optimal printing quality, use a FINE Cartridge within six months of first use.
Note
If a FINE Cartridge runs out of ink, you can print with either Color or Black FINE Cartridge, in whichever ink remains, only for a while.
However the print quality may be reduced compared to when printing with both cartridges.
We recommend to use new FINE Cartridges in order to obtain optimum qualities.
Even when printing with one ink only, print with leaving the empty FINE Cartridge installed.
If either of the Color FINE Cartridge or Black FINE Cartridge is not installed, an error occurs and the machine cannot print.
For information on how to configure this setting, refer to the on-screen manual:  Advanced Guide.
Color ink may be consumed even when printing a black-and-white document or when black-and- white printing is specified.
Both color ink and black ink are also consumed in the standard cleaning and deep cleaning of the
Print Head, which may be necessary to maintain the machine's performance.
When ink runs out, replace the FINE Cartridge immediately with a new one.

Tips on How to Use Your Machine
This section introduces the tips on how to use your machine and for printing with optimal quality.
Ink is used for various purposes.
How is ink used for various purposes other than printing?
Ink may be used for purposes other than printing.
Ink is not only used for printing, but also for cleaning the Print Head to maintain the optimal printing quality.
The machine has the function to automatically clean the ink jet nozzles to prevent clogging.
In the cleaning procedure, ink is pumped out from the nozzles.
Used ink for nozzle cleaning is limited to a small amount.
Does black-and-white printing use color ink?
Black-and-white printing may use color ink depending on the type of printing paper or the settings of the printer driver.
So, color ink is consumed even when printing in black-and-white.
Printing on special paper: How to print with optimal quality!?
Tip!: Check the machine status before printing!
Is the Print Head OK?
If print head nozzles are clogged, print will be faint and papers will be wasted.
Print the nozzle check pattern to check the Print Head.
See When Printing Becomes Faint or Colors Are Incorrect.
Is the inside of the machine smeared with ink?
After printing large quantities of paper or performing borderless printing, the area where papers go through may get smeared with ink.
Clean the inside of your machine with the Bottom Plate
Cleaning.
See Cleaning the Inside of the Machine (Bottom Plate Cleaning).
Tip!: Check how to load the paper correctly!
Is the paper loaded in the correct orientation?
Load paper in the Rear Tray with the printing side facing you.
Is the paper curled?
The curled paper causes paper jam.
Flatten the curled paper, then reload it.
Refer to "Troubleshooting " in the on-screen manual:  Advanced Guide.
Tips on How to Use Your Machine
Page 80 of 678 pages
Tip!: After loading paper, be sure to specify the paper settings!
After loading paper, be sure to select the loaded paper in Media Type of the printer driver or with the
Paper button on the Operation Panel.
If the type of paper is not selected, you may not be able to get the satisfactory print result.
See Copying, Printing from Your Computer, and Media Types You Can Use.
There are various types of paper: paper with special coating on the surface for printing photos with optimal quality and paper suitable for documents.
Media Type of the printer driver has different settings for each type of paper in advance (such as using ink, ejecting ink, or distance from nozzles) so that you can print on each paper with the optimal image quality.
The  Paper button on the
Operation Panel, which is used for making copies, also has some settings similar to Media Type of the printer driver.
You can print with different settings in Media Type of the printer driver or with the
Paper button on the Operation Panel, suitable for each type of loaded paper.
Use the Stop/Reset button to cancel printing!
Tip!: Never press the ON button!
If you press the ON button while printing is in progress, the print data sent from the computer queues in the machine and you may not be able to continue to print.
Press the  Stop/Reset button to cancel printing.

Does the machine need to be handled with care when using or transporting?
Tip!: Do not use or transport the machine vertically or slanted!
If the machine is used or transported vertically or slanted, the machine may become damaged or ink may leak from the machine.
Be sure not to use or transport the machine vertically or slanted.
Tip!: Do not place any object on the Document Cover!
Do not place any object on the Document Cover.
It will fall into the Rear Tray when the Document
Cover is opened and cause the machine to malfunction.
Also, place the machine where objects will not fall on it.
Tips on How to Use Your Machine
Page 81 of 678 pages
Tip!: Carefully choose the area to place the machine!
Place the machine at least 5.91 inches / 15 cm away from other electrical appliances such as fluorescent lamps.
If the machine is placed closer to those, it may not be able to work properly due to fluorescent noises.
How to maintain the optimal printing quality?
The key to printing with the optimal printing quality is to prevent the Print Head from drying or clogging.
Always follow the following steps for optimal printing quality.
Follow the procedure below to disconnect the power plug.
1.
Press the  ON button on the machine to turn it off.
2.
Make sure that the Power lamp is not lit.
3.
Disconnect the power plug from the wall outlet, or turn off the extender cable connector.
If you press the ON button to turn off the power, the machine caps the Print Head (nozzles) automatically to prevent from drying.
If you disconnect the power plug from the wall outlet or turn off the extender cable connector before the  Power lamp is turned off, the Print Head will not be capped properly and this will cause drying or clogging.
To disconnect the power plug, be sure to follow this procedure.
Print periodically!
Just as the tip of a felt pen becomes dry and unusable if it has not been used for a long time, even if it is capped, the Print Head too, may become dried or clogged if the machine has not been used for a long time.
We recommend you to use the machine at least once a month.
Note
Depending on the type of paper, ink may blur if you trace the printed area with a highlight pen or paint-stick, or bleed if water or sweat comes in contact with the printed area.
Colors are uneven, and print results are blurred.
Tip!: Print the nozzle check pattern to check if the nozzles are clogged.
If the print head nozzles are clogged, colors may become uneven or the print results may be blurred.

How Can I Move (or Copy) the Saved File?
If you want to move (or copy) a file created and saved with Easy-PhotoPrint EX from one folder to another, you need to move (or copy) the folder that was automatically created when originally saving that file as well.
For example, when you save a file named "MyAlbum.el1," a folder named "MyAlbum.el1.Data" is automatically created in the same folder that contains the "MyAlbum.el1" file.
If you want to move (or copy) the "MyAlbum.el1" file to another folder, move (or copy) the "MyAlbum.el1.Data" folder as well.
The
"MyAlbum.el1.Data" folder contains the photos used in the album.
Note
The icons may vary depending on the items.
Important
Do not change the Data folder name; otherwise you will not be able to display the photos you edited with Easy-PhotoPrint EX.

Optimal Photo Printing of Image Data
When people print images taken with digital cameras, they sometimes feel that the printed color tones differ from those of actual image or those displayed on the monitor.
To get the print results as close as possible to the desired color tones, you must select a printing method that is best suited to the application software used or to your purpose.
Color Management
Devices such as digital cameras, scanners, monitors, and printers handle color differently.
Color management (color matching) is a method that manages device-dependent "colors" as a common color space.
For Windows, a color management system called "ICM" is built into the operating system.
Adobe RGB and sRGB are popularly used as common color spaces.
Adobe RGB has a wider color space than sRGB.
ICC profiles convert device-dependent "colors" into a common color space.
By using an ICC profile and carrying out color management, you can draw out the color space of the image data within the color reproduction area that the printer can express.
Selecting a Printing Method Suited to the Image Data
The recommended printing method depends on the color space (Adobe RGB or sRGB) of the image data or the application software to be used.
There are two typical printing methods.
Check the color space (Adobe RGB or sRGB) of the image data and the application software to be used, and then select the printing method suited to your purpose.
Adjusting Colors with the Printer Driver
Describes the procedure for printing sRGB data by using the color correction function of the printer driver.
To print using Canon Digital Photo Color
The printer prints data with color tints that most people prefer, reproducing colors of the original image data and producing three-dimensional effects and high, sharp contrasts.
To print by directly applying editing and touch-up results of an application software
When printing the data, the printer brings out subtle color difference between dark and light areas, while leaving the darkest and lightest areas intact.
When printing the data, the printer applies fine adjustment results, such as brightness adjustments made with an application software.
Printing with ICC Profiles
Describes the procedure for printing by using the color space of Adobe RGB or sRGB effectively.
You can print with a common color space by setting up the application software and the printer driver so that the color management matches the input ICC profile of the image data.
The method for setting up the printer driver differs depending on the application software to be used.

Printing with ICC Profiles
When the image data has a specified input ICC profile, you can print by using the color space (Adobe
RGB or sRGB) of the data effectively.
The printer driver setting procedure varies depending on the application software used to print.
Specify an ICC Profile from the Application Software and Print the Data
When you print the editing and touch-up results of Adobe Photoshop, Canon Digital Photo Professional, or any application software that allows you to specify input and printing ICC profiles, you print by effectively using the color space of the input ICC profile specified in the image data.
To use this printing method, use your application software to select color management items and specify an input ICC profile and a printing ICC profile in the image data.
Even if you print using a printing ICC profile that you created yourself or one for special Canon paper from your application software, be sure to select color management items from your application software.

Color Adjustment
Correct colors that have faded with time or due to colorcast.
Colorcast is a phenomenon where a specific color affects the entire picture due to the weather or ambient strong colors.
Click an arrow in Color Adjustment to emphasize the corresponding color.
Cyan & red, magenta & green and yellow & blue are complementary color pairs (each pair produces a shade of gray when mixed).
You can reproduce the natural colors of the scene by reducing the cast color and increasing the complementary color.

Resolution
Resolution
What is Resolution?
The data in the image you have scanned is a collection of dots carrying information about brightness and color.
The density of these dots is called "resolution", and resolution will determine the amount of detail your image contains.
The unit of resolution is dots per inch (dpi).
Dpi is the number of dots per square inch (2.54 cm square).
The higher the resolution (value), the more detail in your image; the lower the resolution (value), the less detail.
Setting the Resolution in MP Navigator EX
In MP Navigator EX, you can specify the resolution with Scanning Resolution in the Scan Settings dialog box.
Images for Printing
Images to be printed should be scanned at a resolution that corresponds to the resolution of the printer.
For example, if you want to print using a 600 dpi black and white printer, you should set the resolution to
600 dpi.
With a color printer, specifying the resolution at half the resolution of the printer should be fine.
For example, if you want to print scanned paper/photos using a 600 dpi color printer, you should set the resolution to 300 dpi.
However, with a high-resolution printer, printing takes longer than usual if you set the resolution to half the resolution of the printer.
Example of Appropriate Resolution when Printing to Scale
If you print a document at twice the size both vertically and horizontally, the resolution of the document will be reduced by half.
If the resolution of the original document is 300 dpi, the resolution of the enlarged document will be 150 dpi.
If you print the document with a 600 dpi color printer, the lack of detail in the image may be obvious.
In that case, if you scan at the Scanning Resolution of 600 dpi, the resolution will be 300 dpi even if you double the size of document and you can print the document with sufficient quality.
Conversely, if you print a document at half scale, it should be sufficient to scan at half the resolution.
When Printing Color Photos at Twice the Size
Document resolution: 300 dpi
Scanning resolution: 600 dpi
Scale: 200%
Print at twice the size
Scanning resolution/actual scanning resolution: 600 dpi
Printing resolution: 300 dpi
Setting the Resolution in ScanGear (Scanner Driver)
In ScanGear (scanner driver), you can specify the resolution with Output Resolution in Output Settings on
Resolution the Advanced Mode tab.
Page 527 of 678 pages
Example of Appropriate Resolution when Printing to Scale
The scanning resolution is automatically set so that the value set in Output Resolution will be the resolution of the scanned image.
If you set Output Resolution to 300 dpi and scan at twice the size, the document will be automatically scanned at 600 dpi, and the resolution of the scanned image will be 300 dpi.
You can print the document with sufficient quality using a 600 dpi color printer.
When Printing L Size (8.9 cm x 12.7 cm) Photos at Twice the Size
Document resolution: 300 dpi
Output resolution: 300 dpi
Scale: 200%
Scan at twice the size

Appropriate Resolution Settings
Set the resolution according to the use of the scanned image.
For displaying on a monitor: 150 dpi
For printing: 300 dpi

Check 3: Load the paper after correcting its curl.
For Plain Paper
Turn the paper over and reload it to print on the other side.
Leaving the paper loaded on the Rear Tray for a long time may cause the paper to curl.
In this case, load the paper with the other side facing up.
It may resolve the problem.
We recommend putting unused paper back into the package and keeping it on a level surface.
For Other Paper
If the curl on the four corners of the paper is more than 0.1 inch / 3 mm (A) in height, the paper may be smudged or may not be fed properly.
In such cases, follow the procedure described below to correct the paper curl.
1.
Roll up the paper in the opposite direction to the paper curl as shown below.
Paper Is Smudged/Printed Surface Is Scratched
Page 592 of 678 pages
2.

We recommend printing curl-corrected paper one sheet at a time.
Note
Depending on the media type, the paper may be smudged or may not be fed properly even if it is not curled inward.
In such cases, follow the procedure described below to curl the paper outward within 0.1 inch / 3 mm (B) in height before printing.
This may improve the print result.
(C) Printing side
We recommend printing paper that has been curled outward one sheet at a time.
Check 4: If you are printing on thick paper, select the Prevent paper abrasion setting.
Selecting the Prevent paper abrasion setting will widen the clearance between the Print Head and the loaded paper.

Instructions for Use (Printer Driver)
This printer driver is subject to the following restrictions.
Keep the following points in mind when using the printer driver.
Restrictions on the Printer Driver
With some applications, the Copies setting in the Page Setup tab of the printer driver may not be enabled.
In this case, use the copies setting in the Print dialog box of the application software.
If the selected Language in the About dialog box does not match the operating system interface language, the driver screen may not be displayed properly.
Do not change the Advanced tab items of the printer properties.
If you change any of the items, you will not be able to use the following functions correctly.
Also, if Print to file is selected in the Print dialog box of the application software and with applications that prohibit EMF spooling, such as Adobe Photoshop LE and MS Photo Editor, the following functions will not operate.
Preview before printing on the Main tab
Prevent loss of print data in the Print Options dialog box
Page Layout, Poster, Booklet, Duplex Printing, Specify Margin..., Print from Last Page, Collate, and
Stamp/Background... on the Page Setup tab
Since the resolution in the preview display differs from the printing resolution, text and lines in the preview display may appear different from the actual print result.
With some applications, the printing is divided into multiple print jobs.
To cancel printing, delete all divided print jobs.
If image data is not printed correctly, display the Print Options dialog box and change the setting of
Disable ICM required from the application software.
This may solve the problem.
Software windows may not appear correctly on Windows Vista when fonts are set to Larger scale.
When you want to display the windows with Larger scale fonts, set the desktop theme to Windows
Classic as follows:
1.
Select Control Panel from the Start menu.
2.
Select Appearance and Personalization -> Personalization -> Theme.
The Theme Settings dialog box opens.
3.
At the Theme Settings dialog box, click the Themes tab, and select Windows Classic from
Theme.
4.
Click OK.
Desktop changes to Windows Classic display.
Points to Note with Applications
There are following restrictions in Microsoft Word (Microsoft Corporation).
When Microsoft Word has the same printing functions as the printer driver, use Word to specify them.
When selecting Scaled, Fit-to-Page, or Page Layout from the Page Layout list on the Page Setup tab, the selected printing function may not be effective, depending on the version of Word.
If this happens, follow the procedure below.

Printing Area
To ensure the best print quality, the machine allows a margin along each edge of media.
The actual printable area will be the area inside these margins.
Recommended printing area
: Canon recommends that you print within this area.
Printable area
: The area where it is possible to print.
However, printing in this area can affect the print quality or the paper feed precision.
Note
Borderless Printing
By selecting Borderless Printing option, you can make prints with no margins.
When performing Borderless Printing, slight cropping may occur at the edges since the printed image is enlarged to fill the whole page.
For Borderless Printing, use the following paper:
Glossy Photo Paper "Everyday Use" GP-501
Photo Paper Glossy GP-502
Photo Paper Plus Semi-Gloss SG-201
Photo Paper Pro Platinum PT-101*
Photo Paper Plus Glossy II PP-201
Photo Paper Pro II PR-201
Matte Photo Paper MP-101
* For MP270 series, this paper can be used only when printing from your computer.
Performing Borderless Printing on any other type of paper may substantially reduce printing quality and/or result in printouts with altered color hues.
Borderless Printing on plain paper may result in printouts with reduced quality.
Use them only for test printing.
You can perform Borderless Printing on plain paper only when printing from your computer.
Borderless Printing is not available for legal, A5, or B5 sized paper, or envelopes.
Depending on the type of paper, Borderless Printing may reduce the print quality at the top and bottom edges of the paper or cause these parts to become smudged.
